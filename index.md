## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
- If phone cannot join the same network, consider using a hotspot from phone
- Check that port 8183 is not blocked by your firewall

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure you've granted camera permissions to the mobile app
- Check that no other app is using the camera
- Try restarting the mobile app

### Performance Issues
- Ensure good lighting for optimal pose detection
- Stay 1-3 meters from the camera
- Close other applications to free up resources
- Older phones and phones without GPUs may struggle, sorry.
